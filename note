The "Vanity Metric" Backlash (The Green Square Problem)
Users are increasingly frustrated with the traditional GitHub contribution graph.
The Problem: High-frequency committers are often seen as "more productive," but users now realize this is easily gamed and doesn't reflect actual effort. A 2,000-line refactor might show as one tiny square, while 10 minor typo fixes show as a "highly active" day.
Your Opportunity: DevMetrics can solve this by providing "Impact Metrics"—visualizing code churn (how much code stayed vs. was deleted), review depth (how much time you spend helping others), and complexity trends.


. The "Fake" Activity Problem
With AI tools like Copilot, it’s now very easy to "fake" being active. Someone can push 100 tiny, low-quality changes in five minutes just to make their profile look busy.

The Problem: Serious developers feel like their hard work is getting buried under "AI noise."

How DevMetrics helps: You can show quality over quantity. Instead of just counting "hits," you can show how much actual logic they wrote or how many tough problems they solved.

Think of DevMetrics as a fitness tracker, but for your coding instead of your steps.

Right now, developers using GitHub are running into a few specific "headaches" that your tool can help solve. Here is the breakdown in simple terms:

1. The "Ghost" Progress Bug
GitHub’s own charts have been acting glitchy lately. Some people look at their 2026 profile and see "green squares" for days they didn't even work, or they see empty spaces where they did work.

The Problem: Users are confused about what is real.

How DevMetrics helps: Since your tool connects directly to their account, it acts as the "Source of Truth." You can show them their actual work, even when GitHub’s website is being buggy.

2. The "Fake" Activity Problem
With AI tools like Copilot, it’s now very easy to "fake" being active. Someone can push 100 tiny, low-quality changes in five minutes just to make their profile look busy.

The Problem: Serious developers feel like their hard work is getting buried under "AI noise."

How DevMetrics helps: You can show quality over quantity. Instead of just counting "hits," you can show how much actual logic they wrote or how many tough problems they solved.

3. The "Slow Loading" Frustration
Lately, GitHub’s "behind-the-scenes" system (the API) has been a bit slow. When people try to connect third-party tools, they often see "Loading..." or "Error" messages.

The Problem: Users lose patience if they have to wait 30 seconds to see their stats.

How DevMetrics helps: If you make your tool fast (by saving their data so it doesn't have to ask GitHub for it every single time), users will love it because it feels smoother than the official site.

4. The "Private Work" Mystery
Many developers do their best work at their jobs in private repositories. When they look at their public GitHub profile, it looks like they haven't done anything.

The Problem: "If it's not public, it didn't happen."

How DevMetrics helps: You can give them a private dashboard that counts their professional work (without leaking the secret code), so they can finally see their total impact in one place.
